To provide a detailed breakdown of the setup process for your Microsoft 365 and Azure licenses, let's start with Microsoft 365 E5 (no Teams) and create a matrix that crosses productivity tools with security features:
Microsoft 365 E5 (no Teams) Setup Matrix

Feature Category 	Productivity Tools 	Security Features 	
Email & Calendar 	Outlook, Exchange Online 	Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) 	
Documents & Collaboration 	Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, SharePoint 	Data Loss Prevention (DLP), eDiscovery 	
Communication 	Skype for Business 	Secure Score, ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams 	
Analytics & Intelligence 	MyAnalytics, Power BI Pro 	Office 365 Cloud App Security 	
Identity & Access Management 	Azure Active Directory 	Conditional Access, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 	

Next, let's consider three automations that could support ongoing optimization and productivity:
- Email Management Automation: Set up rules in Outlook to automatically sort incoming emails into folders, flag important messages, and delete spam, which helps maintain an organized inbox.
- Document Workflow Automation: Use Power Automate to create workflows that automatically route documents for approval, signatures, and storage, streamlining document management.
- Security Compliance Automation: Implement DLP policies across SharePoint and OneDrive to automatically classify and protect sensitive information, ensuring compliance with industry regulations.
These automations can be set up within the respective applications and will work in the background to optimize your operations over time. As you continue to use your Microsoft environment, you can adjust these automations based on your usage patterns and preferences to further enhance efficiency and productivity. If you need more granular details or assistance with specific setup steps, feel free to ask.
